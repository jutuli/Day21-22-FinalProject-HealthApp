The Personalized Health App is a responsive web application designed for a personalized nutrition coaching service. It features a clean user interface, responsive layouts, and dynamic functionality for an engaging user experience.

This project was developed as part of my 6-month Web Development Bootcamp. While the project was planned for Day 21/22 of the curriculum, I joined the bootcamp late and completed it on my Day 12/13. The aim of the project was to practice the concepts from the first module, particularly HTML and CSS. I had 1 Â½ days to replicate a Figma design into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my ability to implement and adapt quickly.
